1. Project Progress
-Started to decorate our scenes (making nice sceneries)
-Trying to make our lava an obsticle
*Deciding what our other characters look like

2. What has been done
*Added a start screen with a button
*Added 5 scenes in our game
*Created an animated scene (moving lava)

3. What we are thinking about doing
*Interaction between character and lava (if you fall into it, math question appears)
*Maybe adding harder levels
*Styling out game
